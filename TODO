- Rework zipfile comparator to use 'zipsum' style (map, clear, cmp).
  Maybe best to borrow back from AO code.c

- Handle Windows "whole program optimization" .obj files, created 
  with the /GL compiler option. These are in an undocumented format
  but with luck it's more or less COFF, enough to allow timestamp
  suppression anyway.
