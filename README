Objcmp is a program for comparing binary object files. A common problem
with comparing binaries is that compilers and related tools often place
datestamps in them, making otherwise-identical builds compare
different. But unlike most other 'cmp' type programs, objcmp knows how
to ignore datestamps in common binary formats.

This problem is most egregious on Windows where datestamps and version
strings (which objcmp also knows how to ignore) are everywhere. But
there are troublesome file formats on Unix too, notably archive (.a)
files. Objcmp knows how to skip datestamps in standard Unix archive
files too.

See the file 'objcmp.pod' for more information. Assuming you have a
working copy of Perl around, you can read it with "perldoc" or convert
it to a classic man page format with "pod2man". Or it can be read with
any text editor.
