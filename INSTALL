HOW TO BUILD:

The objcmp program is built via make. On Unix, adapt the provided
Makefile if required and run make. GNU make is fine.

On Windows with Visual Studio, use "nmake -f NMakefile" afer
running vsvars32.bat. Or use the included .sln/.vcproj files. Or
use the precompiled objcmp.exe file.

Place the resulting executable on your PATH. Done!
